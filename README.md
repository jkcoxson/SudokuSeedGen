# SudokuSeedGen
A C# program to generate sukoku problems

This project was for me to generate a lot of original sudoku problems quickly. 
Usage: currently the only way to configure the program is to edit the source code, then build it
This uses a Python program from another repo (sorry, forgot the name of it) to check to make sure the puzzle is solvable.
